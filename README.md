# Customer-Segmentation

Look to apply unsupervised learning techniques to create customer segments. This is done by analysing a dataset containing data on various customer's annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories.

The. goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. In achieving such, this can have several benefits for the distributor. In doing so, we also shall be simply groupin g customers in clusters of similar spending characteristics. This equips an organisation to better understand their audience and curate product production plans to meet demand timely. 

We shall examine, implement and choose to use either a **K-means** clustering algorithm, **PAM** clustering or a **Gaussian Mixture Model** clustering algorithm to identify the various customer segments hidden in the data.

  2. Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) Clustering
